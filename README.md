## AICamp : Oracle Database 23ai brings AI to the database. 

## Abstract:
Oracle brings the power of AI to the database with Oracle Database 23ai. By now, you've probably heard about Oracle Database 23ai AI Vector 
Search, which essentially transforms the Oracle Database into a powerful, best-in-class Vector Database. But there are many more new innovations 
introduced to support all manner of AI workloads, and best of all, Oracle makes it easy to start using these tools without having to learn any new 
programming languages or frameworks. All of these AI innovations can be used today without any additional installation necessary, and can be
accessed using your favorite code editor or IDE. Perhaps there's a problem you are trying to solve with AI today and don't know where to start? This 
is the session to get you there...

In this session, you will learn how to:
1. Load embedding models into the Oracle database.
1. Run AI Vector Search in your database using regular SQL.
1. Build Agentic RAG operations with Oracle 23ai.
1. Accelerate your AI similarity search operations with HNSW and IVF_Flat indexes.
1. Communicate with your database using natural language prompts with MCP.
1. Use AI to generate synthetic table data.
1. Use AI for document summarization inside the Oracle database.
